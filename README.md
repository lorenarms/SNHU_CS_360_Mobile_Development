<h1>CS 360 - Mobile Architect and Programming</h1>

  Welcome to the repository for the various projects from my CS 360 Mobile Architect and Programming class at SNHU Online! 
  This class focused on the development of a mobile application for Android, starting with planning and researching, and culminating in a working prototype of the application. For the final project I developed an event tracking mobile application for Android, using Android Studio. The application utilyzes a variety of Android subsystems such as RecyclerView for displaying the events, SQL Database helpers for storing both user information, and Alarm Manager to handle notifications for events. Users are able to create a username and password to log into the app, create events, and set a date / time when the event will "fire" as a notification. The events can be updated and deleted, and there is no limit to how many events a user can create. 
  
  During the class I developed a number of other applications in preparation for the final project. Some of these were created from various tutorials online, some were from the text, and some were of my own creation as practice.
